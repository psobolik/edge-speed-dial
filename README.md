# Edge Speed Dial
A simple Speed Dial page for Edge's new tab, which probably works in Chrome, too.
# TODO
(I probably won't do any of these.)
- Arrange bookmarks - You can already set the order of the bookmarks in the "Speed Dial" Favorites folder... 
- Color code bookmarks - The app uses the built-in Favorites folders and doesn't save any other attributes of the bookmarks, so this would probably be more trouble than it's worth.
